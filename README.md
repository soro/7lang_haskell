Haskell 7 lang talk
===================

Slides and code Haskell for my talk in the 7 languages in 7 months series.
You will need PdfTex if you want to compile the slides, so install the LaTeX distribution of your choice - good idea in general.
Just run make and open the haskell.pdf.

To run the slides use `runhaskell haskell.lhs`
If you want to play with the code in ghci, just use `:load haskell.lhs`

If you want to extract the code use `make extract`. The Latex does clutter it up a bit.
If you see an error or would like to make modifications, please feel free to do so and open a pull request.
